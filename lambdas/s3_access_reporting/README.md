# S3 Access Reporting Lambda Function

## Overview

Enclosed is a Python 3 module and associated tests for generating S3 access reports from CloudTrail data.

The module takes an S3 bucket name as input and, with the right permissions in place, uses Athena to process CloudTrail data and create S3 access reports for new and historical log data.

It is meant to be invoked as an AWS Lambda function triggered by a CloudWatch event.
The handler(event, context) function is the module entrypoint.

Currently, the function is set up to automatically trigger every Tuesday at midnight UTC.

## Example Query

One nice thing about this module is that it leverages Athena to perform data processing. So, if you want to run ad hoc queries against the data set, you can with a SQL-like syntax. An example Athena query that was generated by the module is below:

```sql
SELECT useridentity.principalId AS Requester,
         eventname AS Request,
         json_extract(requestparameters,
         '$.bucketName') AS BucketName, json_extract(requestparameters, '$.key') AS Object, sourceipaddress AS SourceIP, count(*) AS NumRequests
FROM s3_access_reporting.s3_access_reporting_117183459779
WHERE eventsource = 's3.amazonaws.com'
        AND region IN ('us-east-1')
        AND ((year = '2020'
        AND month = '06'
        AND day = '27')
        OR (year = '2020'
        AND month = '06'
        AND day = '26')
        OR (year = '2020'
        AND month = '06'
        AND day = '25')
        OR (year = '2020'
        AND month = '06'
        AND day = '24')
        OR (year = '2020'
        AND month = '06'
        AND day = '23')
        OR (year = '2020'
        AND month = '06'
        AND day = '22')
        OR (year = '2020'
        AND month = '06'
        AND day = '21'))
GROUP BY  useridentity.principalId, eventname, json_extract(requestparameters, '$.bucketName'), json_extract(requestparameters, '$.key') , sourceipaddress
ORDER BY  useridentity.principalId, eventname

```

You can copy and paste that into Athena, tweak it as needed, and submit to get real live results.
